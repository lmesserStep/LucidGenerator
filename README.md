# Draw.IO Chart Generator for Lucid Chart Import

This Python script enables the generation of a Draw.IO chart that can be directly imported into Lucid Chart using the Draw.IO import functionality.

## Prerequisites

The script requires modifications to the `drawio` library in order to function correctly. Ensure that you have the modified library ready before attempting to use this script.

## Usage

1. Generate a LibreNMS API key.
2. Run the script and provide the information requested during the initial start-up.
3. The script will generate an XML file.
4. Import the generated XML into either Draw.IO or LucidChart.

For detailed instructions on how to generate an API key in LibreNMS, refer to the official documentation or follow the prompts provided by the script during execution.

## Importing to Lucid Chart

Once you have the XML file, you can import it into Lucid Chart by following these steps:

1. Open Lucid Chart.
2. Navigate to the 'File' menu.
3. Select 'Import Diagram'.
4. Choose 'Draw.IO' as the import format.
5. Browse to the XML file generated by this script and select it for import.

The diagram should now be imported into Lucid Chart, where you can edit and save it as part of your project workflows.
